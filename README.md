# Paradise

This Demo project is mainly a practice full stack assignment. In this platform we can buy cyramics dining products online. IT will show us various services according to the facilities the "Paradise" site will give us. And one can easily view all the Products and fascilitites . I tried to update the project using React , react-router for practice purpose. Here I practiced some new thing also like privateRoute, ContextApi, AuthProvider, Firebase etc. For Database purpose I've used express and mongoDB. The main purpose behind making this site was practicing express.js.
